# KV-RAPTOR

This is the official repo from the paper KV-RAPTOR: Scalable Tree-Structured Retrieval with KV Cache Compression for Question-Answering Systems.

## Description

**KV-RAPTOR** is a GPU-accelerated variant of the RAPTOR indexing framework, designed to improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) quality. It integrates hierarchical retrieval with LM Cache framework to reuse key-value tokens and reduce latency to generate answers.
